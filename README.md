# E-commerce_Product_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes product pricing and trends in the e-commerce domain using machine learning. It follows the complete data science workflow from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

A **Flask app** allows users to interactively explore product data and predictions, while a **Power BI dashboard** provides key insights and visualizations.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and correlation analysis to understand product trends and pricing patterns.  
- **Feature Engineering & Scaling:** Preparing numerical and categorical features for machine learning models.  
- **Model Training:** Predicting product prices or trends using Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor and GridSearchCV for tuning.  
- **Evaluation:** Metrics including **RMSE, MAE, R²**, and performance visualization.  
- **Interactive App:** **Flask-based web app** for exploring product data and predictions.  
- **Dashboard:** Visual summaries of product trends, sales, and pricing patterns.
